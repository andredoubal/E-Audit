"""The awkward cases — the ones a sceptical stakeholder reaches for at a demo.

The SIT suite proves the agents work on well-formed material and the UAT walk proves the journey
holds together. This is the third question: what happens at the edges, where a wrong answer is
delivered confidently rather than refused?

Most of these assert a **silence** or a **refusal**. That is deliberate. Every one of them is a
place where the engine could produce a plausible-looking number that is wrong — a purchase
listing totalled into the sales box, a blank cell counted as zero, a taxpayer who over-declared
reported as having understated. A tool that is wrong in those places is worse than no tool,
because the auditor has no way to see it happening.
