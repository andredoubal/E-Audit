"""User acceptance: one case, worked the way an auditor works it, through the real API.

`test_sit_agents.py` asks whether the parts are right. This asks the different question the
auditors will ask at the demo: *can I do my job with this?* So it is written as their journey,
end to end, one test per thing they said they needed — and it goes through the HTTP layer,
because a check that passes in Python but returns 422 to the screen has not passed.

Every acceptance criterion here traces to something the audit team asked for:

* a case that says who the taxpayer is, what they are registered to do, and whether we have
  audited them before;
* the email they already sent, read back as a checkable list;
* the spreadsheets that came in, and a straight answer on what falls short;
* a chase email written from the gaps and nothing else;
* four agents whose reasoning is visible and whose wording is the Authority's;
* their own arithmetic checked against the source, in the words they would use;
* an outbound letter and an audit report at the end.

The suite runs with **no API key**, which is the point: every step below has to work on the
deterministic path, because that is the path the demo will run on.
