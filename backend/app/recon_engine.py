"""Reconstruction and comparison (deterministic core).

Rebuilds the **expected** VAT return from the taxpayer's e-invoices and compares it to the
declared boxes. Every number here is computed — no AI, no estimation.

The rules run *during* aggregation, never after it. Each tax-subtotal line is walked through
`app/pipeline` — status, tax point, category, adjustment — and only the lines that survive
are summed. A rule can therefore do things a subtraction cannot: move a supply to the next
period (where it must also *arrive*), move a line between boxes, and admit each line exactly
once so two rules cannot double-count the same document.

That order rules out a whole class of misleading output, and the shape of this module
reflects it. There is **no pre-qualification total**. Such a figure would have to include
documents the rules put in another period and exclude documents the rules admit, purely so a
waterfall could be drawn from it — it would correspond to nothing, and every "explained by
rules" percentage derived from it would be one artifact over another. A rule that fires has
already changed which documents count; there is nothing left for it to explain.

What the module publishes instead is the narrowing itself — `funnel`, an ordered account of
how the population became the qualifying set, straight from the line decisions — and then a
plain comparison:

    expected − declared            = difference
    difference − taxpayer evidence = unexplained

Every funnel step carries a `detail` payload (the underlying invoices, the rule and the
computation) so the UI can open a drill-down for any figure.
