"""The Precedent Analyst — what comparable cases turned out to be, and what closed them.

This is the agent that answers the auditors' fourth pain point: the knowledge of how a case
like this usually resolves currently lives in whichever auditor has seen enough of them.

It runs in **planning**, before any request goes out, because its most useful output is not a
verdict — it is *which evidence to ask for*. Knowing that on this indicator the sales analysis
closed half the comparable cases and the bank statements closed almost none is worth more at
the drafting stage than at the conclusion.

Two rules keep it honest:

* Every figure comes from `precedent.index.summarise()`, which counts and takes medians over
  labelled closed cases. The agent computes nothing itself.
* Its `Hypothesis` claims stay figure-free, like every other agent's. The one hypothesis it
  raises — that a taxpayer seen before may be here for the same reason — reuses the existing
  `recurrence` test rather than adding a parallel mechanism.

Prose in `narrative()` is engine-authored, so it may state digits; text a model writes about
this briefing may not, and is checked as usual.
