"""The evidence agents.

Hypothesis *generation* is pattern work, not language work, so these run deterministically
and need no model or API key — which is why the investigation still works in the offline
demo. Each agent looks at the shape of the reconciled case and proposes the questions worth
asking; none of them answers one. Claims are deliberately figure-free: the adjudicator
supplies every number.

A model can later enrich the claim language or add agents that need judgement (legal,
policy, precedent) without changing this contract.
