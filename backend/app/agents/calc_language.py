"""Read the auditor's stated method deterministically, before any model is asked.

The auditors described this step in their own words: *"it might be just a free text that they
tell you, I calculated X, Y, Z. This is what I got. Can you check it for me?"* So the input is a
sentence, not a form — and a sentence has to be interpreted before Python can recompute anything.

Interpretation is judgement work, which is why `llm.parse_calculation` exists. But the plainest
sentences are not judgement work at all: *"I summed the VAT column on the sales analysis"* names
an operation and a column, and reading it needs a cue table rather than a model. Sending it to
one anyway would mean the whole feature dies the moment there is no API key — and everything
else in this system stays usable without one.

So this is the first pass. It answers the sentences it is sure of and declines the rest, and the
model picks up whatever it declines. Deterministic first, model second, exactly as elsewhere.

**The decisive rule is what it refuses.** A method that carries a *condition* — "for January
only", "excluding the credit notes", "over SAR 50,000" — is not a bare aggregation, and reading
it as one would total the whole file and then report the auditor's correct figure as a
disagreement. Being wrongly told they have made an error is far more expensive to an auditor
than being told the sentence needs a model, so a condition this pass cannot express makes it
decline outright. It never silently drops a clause.
