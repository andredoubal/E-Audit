"""Drive the calculation agent: parse the auditor's method, execute it, record the verdict.

Three steps, and the split between them is the safety property. A sentence becomes a query,
Python executes the query (`calculation.run`), and the result is written down with the query
beside it. Nobody has to trust the model's arithmetic, because the model never performs any.

Reading the sentence has two passes. `calc_language.read_method` handles the plain ones with a
cue table — a total of a named column over a named file is not judgement work — and only what it
declines goes to `llm.parse_calculation`. That ordering is the usual one here, and it is also
what keeps the feature alive with no API key.

Two entry points, because the auditors described two habits:

* `ask` — "how many invoices did they actually send?" The auditor wants a number off the
  documents and does not want to build a pivot table to get it.
* `check` — "I made it SAR 2,075,000." The auditor already has a number and wants it tested
  against the source.

Both run the same executor. `check` is `ask` plus a comparison, which is why a disagreement can
always say *what* was recomputed and over how many rows: the auditor can see whose assumption
differs instead of simply being told they are wrong.
