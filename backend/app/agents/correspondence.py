"""Draft the outbound letters: the information request, and the follow-up that chases gaps.

§8 named report preparation and taxpayer correspondence as the administrative burdens worth
automating, and §2 asked specifically for the follow-up to be drafted automatically from the
gaps found. Both are language work over facts the engine already established, which is exactly
where a model belongs and exactly where it must not be allowed to invent.

The rule is unchanged from the rest of the system, restated for prose that quotes documents
rather than reconciliation scalars: **the engine states every figure; Claude may repeat one it
was given and may not introduce one.** `verify_correspondence` enforces it by requiring every
numeric literal in the draft to appear in the facts block. On failure there is one corrective
retry, then the deterministic draft below — which is complete, sendable English, not a stub.

The follow-up lists *only* what is still outstanding. Re-asking for something already supplied
is the fastest way to lose an auditor's trust, and the gap list already knows the difference.
