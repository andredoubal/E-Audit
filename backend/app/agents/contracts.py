"""The contracts every investigation agent speaks.

The rule that keeps this safe: **agents hypothesise, the engine adjudicates.** An agent
never states a figure. It returns a `TestSpec` — a typed, engine-executable question — and
a deterministic adjudicator answers it against the reconciliation, returning the verdict
*and* the SAR amount. So the core invariant is unchanged: the numbers live in Python.

Agents also never talk to each other in free text. They read and append typed entries on a
shared case file, which is what makes a conclusion auditable after the fact.
