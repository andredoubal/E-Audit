"""Compare what was requested against what arrived.

This is the check the auditors described doing by hand on every response, and it is most of
pain point 2: time spent on structure, completeness, fields, calculations and formatting rather
than on tax. It is also the reason a case takes months — each round of "you left out two
columns" costs weeks.

**Deterministic first, model second.** Almost none of this needs judgement. Whether a column is
present, whether a mandatory field is blank, whether the rows cover the period asked for, and
whether a stated total equals the sum of its own column are all *checks*. They run here, with no
model, no credentials, and a reproducible answer. Only two questions genuinely need judgement —
whether a document addresses what was asked, and whether an explanation is specific enough — and
those belong to the document reviewer, which is allowed to be wrong and is checked afterwards.

Gaps are recomputed from scratch on every run. A resolved gap simply stops being produced, so
there is no reconciliation of gap state to get wrong.

The arithmetic check is the taxpayer half of §7's two error sources; the auditor half — did we
transcribe the taxpayer's own total correctly — is the `RecomputedTotal` test in the adjudicator.
