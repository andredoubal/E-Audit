"""The audit report, built against the Authority's own template.

The template the audit team supplied has six blocks — taxpayer information, case information,
the assigned team, taxpayer documentation, the audit outcome, and risk feedback. This module
fills them from the case, and it is deliberately explicit about the difference between three
states, because an auditor signing a report needs to be able to tell them apart:

* **filled** — the engine established it. It carries a figure or a fact from the case file.
* **not held** — the proof-of-concept has no source for it (contact details, the audit team's
  names, the field-audit date). Written as `[not held]` rather than left blank, so an empty
  cell is never mistaken for "nothing to report".
* **for the auditor** — a judgement the report needs and the machine must not make. Rulings
  given verbally, penalties, whether a future audit is warranted.

Nothing here invents a value. A section with no basis says so.

The section order and headings follow the template exactly, so the output can be pasted into
the Authority's document without rearrangement.
